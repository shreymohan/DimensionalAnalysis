# Dimensional Analysis

### Principal Component Analysis

* In this project PCA has been implemented to analyze the variance of every feature in the dataset.
* We visualize the decrasing variance using a graph where x axis is the principal component and y axis is the variance.

### Linear Discriminant Analysis

* LDA is used to analyze the variance between different classes in the dataset hence transforming the vector space into a dimension which clearly distinguishes different classes.
* In order to do so, we project our data onto a new axis W which we find in the process.
* Here LDA is implemented and then applied on the iris dataset where the data is projected onto W.
* We visualize this projection and see how it shows three different classes.
* LDA can also be implemented for the purpose of classification.
